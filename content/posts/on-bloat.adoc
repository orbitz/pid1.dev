I recently got sent the slides for a talk titled _On Bloat_ by Rob Pike, that
can be found
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSmIbSwh1_DXKEMU5YKgYpt5_b4yfOfpfEOKS5_cvtLdiHsX6zt-gNeisamRuCtDtCb2SbTafTI8V47/pub?slide=id.p[here].
I don't know the origin of the talk or what the intention was and only have the
slides to go by.

The presentation makes the superficial observation that hardware has become
significantly faster since the first mainframes yet software does not feel like
it has utilized those gains well.  Computers don't boot instantly.  Logging into
your bank has some noticeable latency, etc.

This segues in to how code size has grown considerably and this has all sorts
of consequences, including slower programs and more bugs.  The primary drivers
of this are:

. Features - Mo features mo code.
. Layering - Rather than fixing things where they are broken, we add layers to
work around them.
. Dependencies - We are too eager to reach for a dependency.
. Open source development - The incentives in open source are to accept code
regardless of it standard, which is generally not great.

I am definitely on the side of software should be leaner.  I generally implement
my own dependencies rather than reach to something else and I'm very cautious
in pulling in large dependencies.  I don't like the JavaScript ecosystem for
many reasons, but one of them because the "Hello World" of a lot of web
frameworks requires hundreds of dependencies.

But I hate these slides.  The problem with them is that they make facile
observations, without either providing the history, "how we got here", or
actionable advice for moving forward.

Take the slide on "Features".  The conclusion is:

"Must account for the expense of maintenance and growth when deciding to add a
feature.  Not all "useful" things are worth the long-term cost"
-- Rob Pike

Ok, so what are am I to do with that?  Tell a potential customer "no" when they
ask for a feature that is important to them?  Maybe that is what "useful" means
here?  I have no idea.  At least in the slide, there is nothing to indicate how
I should consider a feature, how to decide what the long-term cost is, how to
think about any of this.  It's just a tautological statement based on the
obvious conclusion: less features means less code.

Or take the section on dependencies.  The observation is that in various
language ecosystems, we use more or less dependencies.  We tend to reach for a
dependency rather than implementing the feature our selves.

The conclusion is:

"Do not add dependency on a component without being aware of all the indirect
dependencies you are also adding to your project and what they do"
-- Rob Pike

Ok, what am I supposed to do with this?  Not use the dependency?  Do I have to
rewrite everything myself?  Is size of dependency the only thing important?
What if the smaller dependency is less maintained or poorer quality?  How do I
weigh my options when it comes to choosing a dependency?  There is no direction
on how to act.

The advice at the end is:

. Avoid features that add disproportionate cost
. Implement things at the right level
. Understand and minimize dependencies whenever possible
. Maintain your dependency tree religiously.  Examine it regularly.
. Don't use dependencies just to be lazy: understand the costs.
. Finalize your changes before they land, not after.

It's hard to imagine a less helpful list.

I find the advice on bloat especially ironic given the source: a designer of Go.
Go, a language that made the explicit decision to choose writing more code,
increasing the bloat, rather than provide abstractions that reduce the amount of
code a user has to write.  Only relatively recently did it get generics, such
that we only need to write one instance of a function for all types that do the
same thing.  Given its popularity and lack of expressiveness, Go is probably the
largest offender in the contribution of bloat in the last 15 years.

I agree with many of the observations but how does this advice help a
practitioner?  How can we change something without understanding how we got
there?  Changing this is about changing the culture of development.  Why do
JavaScript developers tend to use so many more dependencies?  Is it viable to
tell them to just stop?  Probably not.  And what is a developer to do about some
undesirable behaviour in the platform they develop on, whether it be the browser
or their OS.  Just fix it?  I would love it if we tried to improve the right
layer, but how can we begin to do that without understanding why we build these
layers in the first place?

Bloat is real.  Bloat is a problem.  How to solve it is not as easy as just not
implementing a feature or saying no to a dependency.
