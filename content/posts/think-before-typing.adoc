One of the primary skills I try to impart to people that I mentor is to "think
before you type".  This is obviously not a new idea but I suspect, with the
proliferation of LLMs to write code, that stopping to think will be a rarer
skill in software engineering.

An analogy I use is that coding is like getting from A to B.  You don't start
going in a direction until you know which direction you need to go.  You need to
understand where you want to be before even any automation can help you.

In my experience, this commonly plays out in two ways:

. Implementing a feature and just start writing the code for it.  Often times
features have edge cases that you need to think about in order to realize and
those edge cases impact the architecture of the code.  In an existing code base,
new features often need to be considered within the context of the existing
features which might require quite a good deal of thought to ensure it fits with
the existing goals and architecture, and most importantly, doesn't break
anything unexpectedly.
. Debugging.  I have, many times, been pairing with someone where we get an
error and the person just starts trying things they think might solve the
problem.  More often than not, the error message includes what went wrong and
sometimes it includes how to resolve it.  Taking a minute to read the error and
considering the change that caused it would have made what to do immediately
clear.

I think supporting someone to think more is where great mentorship shines.

If you are mentoring someone and notice this, some things I keep in mind that
might be helpful:

. Unless you have hit the point where there is trust between the two of you, it
could be that they feel a bit anxious around their mentor, especially when
things aren't working, and are clicking around and trying random things because
they are nervous.
. Probably they are quite smart and they have been able to intuit themselves to
solutions in the past.  This can work at a certain level of difficulty but, in
my opinion, there is a ceiling.  In a complex world, just creating permutations
of code will not make progress towards a complex solution.
. Often times the mentee is young and inexperienced and impatience is a common
trait when someone is younger.

In all cases, my approach is to be supportive and explicit.  They may not
realize what they are doing or think it's the only way to solve a problem.  It
depends on the relationship.  In some cases, I have told the mentee to stop,
push away from the keyboard, and take a few breaths.  In others I've not done
anything when I've noticed it but brought it up as a discussion topic at the end
of a session.

I'm not a professional mentor, it's not an activity I specifically seek out,
I've just had the opportunity to work with young, hard working, and curious
engineers in the past, and have tried my best teach the lessons that I thought
worked out from my experience.
