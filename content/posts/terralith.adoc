https://github.com/terrateamio/terrateam[Terrateam] has a very expressive
configuration file.  We need it because, as any Terraform or Tofu user knows,
there is no standard on how you should design your repository.  The Eternal
September question of https://old.reddit.com/r/terraform/[r/terraform] is asking
how to structure a repository for multiple environments.  It comes up so much
that we even https://terrateam.io/blog/terraform-code-organization/[wrote a blog
post] about it.

Terraform and Tofu users, in my experience, are especially concerned with how to
structure a repository.  I think this is because Tofu is so low-level.  It
concerns itself with how to manage the specific resources within your
infrastructure but not really your infrastructure as a whole.  Tofu manages a
state file, which is how it connects the code you write to the actual
infrastructure in the cloud.  Each directory that has a state file associated
with it is called a _root module_.  You run the Tofu program in a root module
and it evaluates everything.

NOTE: I will refer to OpenTofu but unless otherwise specified, everything
applies to Terrraform as well.

Putting all of your infrastructure in a root module is called a _Terralith_ and
is generally frowned upon.  Masterpoint, a great IaC consulting company,
probably has the best
https://masterpoint.io/updates/terralith-monolithic-terraform-architecture/[blog
post] on the Terralith.  As they put it:

"A single massive root module that contains all the infrastructure definitions
is like trying to cram an entire city into one skyscraper!"
-- Masterpoint

== The Argument Against the Terralith

Recommending breaking your infrastructure up across multiple root directories
comes down to a few things:

. **Credentials management** - If you have a Terralith with multiple environments to
manage, those environments need their individual configuration accessible at the
time of run.  Generally, each environment will have their own credentials.  In a
Terralith, you must create a provider for each one of those configurations.
. **Blast radius** - The more resources in a root module, the more resources can
be impacted by a change.  Many people believe that it's best to limit the
possible damage that could be done by a mistake by keeping root modules small.
+
"So what do we mean by blast radius? Weâ€™re talking about minimising the amount
of damage you can do with a mistake, error or bug in your IaC."
-- https://samcogan.com/reducing-your-blast-radius/[Sam Cogan]
. **Speed** - By default, Tofu compares all resources in the state file to the
cloud provider.  The more resources in a state file, the longer that takes.
. **State locking** - It's best practice to enable state locking, which means
that only one operation can be performed at a time in a root module.  Combined
with speed of those operations, that means that each user has to wait until all
operations before them have completed in order to see the result of their
operation, really reducing their iteration speed.

The recommendation is to split up your infrastructure into many root modules.
Networking could be its own root modules, database another, applications
another.  In the case that one root module needs access to the outputs of
another root module you can use the
https://opentofu.org/docs/v1.7/language/state/remote-state-data/[terraform_remote_state],
to gain access to the other root module's state file.  These root modules should
then be orchestrated.

All of this works.  It's considered best practice.  Terrateam has excellent
support for
https://docs.terrateam.io/advanced-workflows/multiple-environments/#using-directories-for-multiple-environments[defining]
and https://docs.terrateam.io/advanced-workflows/layered-runs/[orchestrating]
all of this.  It's what our blog post recommends people do.

== Trade-offs

Technical decisions are often about weighing the trade-offs between the options
rather than one being outright better.  Splitting infrastructure across
resources does address the stated problems with a Terralith.  It also introduces
its own problems.

In my view, there are two big trade-offs when it comes to splitting
infrastructure across multiple root modules:

. **Blast radius** - While it's true that reducing the number of resources in a
root module does limit the direct impact of a change or a mistake to those
resources, the indirect damage can be just as bad.  What's worse is that there
is no way to make the downstream impacts visible.  Consider a situation where we
have a database root module that multiple application root modules depend on via
the `terraform_remote_state` data source.  If we make a change to the database,
the plan will only show how the database changes.  If those changes conflict
with how the application layers use the database change, we won't see that in
the plan.  Compare that with how a change would look in a Terralith.  The plan
for a change to the database would show that the application resources are
impacted.

I think Robert Hafner articulates it better than I:
+

> modules. Most changes are small and only affect a handful of resources (if
> that isn't the case for your team then break things up into smaller pieces and

-- Robert Hafner, Author of https://www.manning.com/books/terraform-in-depth[Terraform in Depth]
+
I have also struggled to really understand the blast radius concern because a
standard Tofu workflow involves performing a `plan` operation, reviewing it,
then performing the `apply`.  One can see what Tofu will do before it does it.
How can blast radius be such a concern, then?  In asking around, I believe early
users of Terraform had some bad experiences when Terraform and providers were
less stable and plans less reliable.  I've heard some form of this from multiple
people but never a concrete example of this happening recently.  In my opinion,
this is not a good argument for multiple root modules.  If providers are not
executing the plan faithfully, that is a bug, and bugs should to be fixed.  I do
sympathize with the fear.  Nobody wants to have downtime due to a bug but how
long do we have base our best practices on these stories that are more like
urban legends at this point?
. **Refactoring** - It's easy to come into an existing repository and see how it
should have been laid out but starting from scratch is different.  Most people
will probably begin with a Terralith which they will then have to refactor into
multiple root modules as the infrastructure grows.  And then those root modules
will need to be refactored as needs change.
+
While it is possible to refactor code and move resources into different state
files, it does require some state surgery.  That work cannot be done in a normal
workflow that can be reviewed, it requires using the `tofu state` commands.
There is the
https://opentofu.org/docs/language/modules/develop/refactoring/#moved-block-syntax[moved]
block, but that is for refactoring inside a root module, not moving resources
across root modules.
+
Code is always going to need to be refactored.  Refactoring within a root module
is straight forward: just move the code around and used `moved` blocks.  But the
multi-root module approach adds an extra layer of complexity and room for
mistake.  It takes time, it requires users to get direct access to the state, it
requires blocking operations during the surgery.  It's time spent, with risk,
that is necessary only because the lack of sufficient tooling is forcing us.

What I find especially hard to swallow is that the reasoning behind splitting
infrastructure across multiple root modules is backwards.  When we contemplate
how to design software, we think about it in the abstract.  We think about how
we can express solutions to problems in ways that humans can understand and then
we build tooling to match that.  The famous paper by D.L. Parnas
https://wstomv.win.tue.nl/edu/2ip30/references/criteria_for_modularization.pdf[On
the Criteria To Be Used in Decomposing Systems into Modules], for example, is
focused on how to make the programmer effective, not the limitations of the
tools.

But when we talk about how to design our infrastructure code, we start with the
limitations of our tooling and try to derive what we can do within those
constraints and then call that best practice.  Imagine if the best practice in
Python was to split code into modules not because that is what helps users write
better programs but because Python simply cannot handle large modules.  I think
that would be viewed as a problem that should be solved.  Compiler and run-time
optimizations are an interesting parallel here.  It's common in programming
languages for communities to converge on a certain way to express a solution and
for the compiler and run-time team to introduce optimizations to support that
solution better.

That is not to say that a Terralith is the right solution but rather that we
should motivate splitting infrastructure across root modules not by how to work
around the limitations of Terraform and Tofu but by how it helps the user.  In
this way, I disagree with the Masterpoint's analogy that a Terralith is like
cramming an entire city into a sky scrapper.  Whether or not your infrastructure
is represented by multiple root modules or a Terralith, it's the same
infrastructure with the same inter-dependencies.  Expressing that infrastructure
in a single root module does not make that more complex.  Using
https://opentofu.org/docs/language/modules/[child modules], we can break a
Terralith into the same logical units that we would if we used multiple root
modules.

== But What If We Could

I think it's worth clearing one's mind of the arguments for or against a
Terralith and genuinely consider the question: what would have to be true for a
Terralith to be the best practice?

In my opinion:

. We must be able to see all resources that are impacted by a change in a
single plan.
. We must be able to target logical units of our infrastructure and the run-time
of an operation must reflect that.
. We must be able to run plans concurrently.
. We must be able to run applies that do not overlap in their change set
concurrently.

I think Terraform and Tofu do not have the features to make this happen but
they're pretty close. They do expose the primitives that a wrapper can be built
to give a better experience.

I wrote a proof of concept called
https://github.com/terrateamio/terralith[Terralith] to play with this.  To
migrate to it:

. Move the provider definitions from your existing root modules and into a
single root module.
. Refactor the provider configurations such that the credentials for each of
them can be passed in together.  For example instead of `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
maybe `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_$stack`.
. Instantiate your previous root modules in a `module` block, passing in the
required providers as provider aliases.
. Merge all the state files together (this requires some state surgery but
certainly something the Terralith tool could provide).

Starting from scratch is simpler, of course, because no state surgery.

The tool, `terralith`, does not do anything sophisticated.  It calls each module
in the root module directory a _stack_ and lets you operate against them with
the `--stack` option.  It translates a `--stack` to `-target=module.$stack` to
limit operations to a particular stack.

"You can use the `-target` or the `-exclude` option to trigger resource
targeting, focusing OpenTofu's attention on only a subset of resources. Using
the `-target` option will focus OpenTofu's attention only on resources and
module that are directly targeted, or are dependencies of the target."
-- https://opentofu.org/docs/cli/commands/plan/#resource-targeting[OpenTofu]

What is nice about this approach is that even if one runs `terralith plan
--stack=database`, OpenTofu will automatically plan resources in stacks that
depend on `database` if they are dependencies.  You can see the full impact of a
change in a single plan.  It also means that a `plan` will only take as long as
it takes to compare those specific resources which have changed in the code.

The `-target` option has a bad rap.  Tofu even outputs a warning when used.
Most of that, in my opinion, comes from people using `-target` when they are in
a pickle.  Most usage of it is unprincipled.  In `terralith`, usage of `-target`
is very limited, it only applies it to modules which can be treated as stacks.

The tool doesn't solve all the issues in the Masterpoint blog post.  It doesn't
even hit the requirements listed above for making a Terralith a best practice.
In particular, given that a state file can only be modified as an atomic unit,
any long plans or applies will block other developers.  To get around this,
`terralith` disables locking and state refresh on a `plan`, meaning that
multiple plans can be executed at the same time.  An `apply` will still lock the
state.

A single state file also means that managing access may have to be done
differently.  All of the infrastructure is split out across multiple modules, so
access policy can still be made based on which files have been modified, but
there is only one state file and one directory, which may impact how someone is
doing access control.

I will be interested to know how much these limitations matter in real
infrastructure.  Most users are probably using a tool to orchestrate their Tofu
runs.  That tool should be smart enough to know when certain operations can be
performed concurrently and which need to be queued.  It also probably can manage
apply requirements and access control.  There is always open source
https://github.com/terrateamio/terrateam[Terrateam] (yeah yeah, I'm biased) if
one is looking for a solution, but plenty of choices exist out there.

Terralith is a proof of concept and I plan on testing it against more real-world
examples.  What I like about it is how thin of a wrapper it is around Tofu,
unlike Terragrunt and Terramate.  That isn't to say Terralith is a drop in
replacement, but it accomplishes a lot with very little.

This also wouldn't be much to roll into OpenTofu.  I could imagine it adding a
`stack` block which is the same as a `module` block except it can be explicitly
targeted with a `-stack` parameter.  I think a more challenging change would be
if OpenTofu could allow more fine-grained state access.

== Conclusion

Making the PoC lead to a great discussion in the
https://opentofu.org/slack/[OpenTofu Slack] with Martin Atkins, one of the
OpenTofu developer.  How, and most importantly if, OpenTofu should try to
support a Terralith better.  There was no conclusion, but he was very thoughtful
about the pros and cons, the use cases, and what it would mean to support those
use cases, and provided perspective and context.

What I found most interesting in learning about Terraliths is that it was hard
to get concrete examples of when and how a Terralith fails.  The Masterpoint
blog post lays out explicit limitations of a Terralith and gives us points to
have a discussion around, but for many people I talked to, they simply didn't
trust the tooling.  They didn't trust a plan to either accurately represent the
changes or to be faithfully applied.  And they didn't trust `-target` to do what
the documentation says.  I think this lack of trust in tooling is something that
should be understood more.  How can that be improved?  Additionally, I felt a
lot of the negative sentiment around a Terralith was based on rumors and
stories.  When I asked for concrete examples of the last time a plan was not
accurate, I couldn't get first-hand accounts.  I don't know how bad those early
days were but it left its mark.  The only exception in those who I talked to was
Robert Hafner, author a book on Terraform and OpenTofu, who was supportive of a
Terralith.

Of course, my sample was people who were interested in talking, had opinions,
and wanted to express them.  I'm sure there are plenty of users out there, with
a Terralith, making changes day-in-and-day-out, getting by just fine.  But if
you are new to Terraform and OpenTofu, and ask for help, those are the voices
that will lend their view.

I went into this Terralith-curious and came out very much in support of a
Terralith.  I just think, despite the limitations, being able to plan all of
your infrastructure at once is too valuable to give up.  I trust Tofu to create
an accurate plan and I trust Tofu to apply it.  I think that the general
recommendation should be to do a Terralith unless your situation really
precludes it.
