title: "In Defense of -target"

I've been, rightly, downvoted in r/terraform for recommending
https://old.reddit.com/r/Terraform/comments/1j55d1p/steps_to_break_up_a_terralith/mgo8ghx/[using
-target] in production.  I say "rightly" because I know it's a controversial
suggestion and I've just sort of dropped it like a bomb without defending my
position.  So here is my defense.

== tl;dr When and how to use -target

My concrete recommendation on when to use `-target` is as follows:

If your infrastructure is hitting the point that `plan` operations are taking
too long and slowing you down, rather than refactor your code into multiple root
modules, you should refactor it into child modules, and then use `-target` in
automation to plan those specific child modules independently.  With this,
`-target` is used in a principled and controlled fashion, not just targeting
arbitrary resources.  This gives us many of the speed benefits we would get by
refactoring our code into multiple root modules but we also lets Terraform/Tofu
handle the heavy lifting of orchestrating our runs and we get to see the
complete impact of a change because `-target` will plan every resource impacted
by the change, even if it's not listed in `-target`.

== What is -target

In order to defend my position, first a little context.  The situation where
I've been recommending using `-target` is for maintaining a
link:/posts/terralith/[Terralith].  Rather than split a Terralith into a bunch
of root modules, I recommend maintaining a Terralith and using `-target` to
conceptually split it up.

The problem with `-target` is not that it is bad but that that it has a bad
reputation.  Terraform and OpenTofu even spit out a warning (that cannot be
turned off, AFAIK) if you use it:

> Note that the -target option is not suitable for routine use, and is provided
  only for exceptional situations such as recovering from errors or mistakes, or
  when Terraform specifically suggests to use it as part of an error message.

This warning annoys me for a few reasons.  First of all, don't go tellin' me how
to manage my infrastructure Terraform/Tofu.  I'm the boss.  But more seriously,
there is nothing incorrect or broken about the implementation of `-target`, it
works entirely as the documentation says, so if your problem fits into the
solution that `-target` provides, then it's perfectly reasonable to use it.

What does `-target` do?  It limits the operation that Terraform/Tofu is doing to
the addresses passed in via `-target` as well as any dependencies of those
addresses that are impacted by the change.  The last part, in particular, is
important.

== The problem with -target

The problem with `-target` is not the functionality itself but rather that it is
historically used in an unprincipled way.  The reputation it has (probably, in
large part, due to the warning) combined with the reality that most uses of
`-target` are in situations where the infrastructure is in a bad state, further
cement that `-target` is bad practice.

Now, I think we could have a reasonable debate on if the scenarios where
`-target` is used should negatively reflect on the feature itself.  I stand on
the side of "no".  We should look at what `-target` does, what scenarios it has
value, and evaluate the feature on its own merits.

== Why do I care?

Splitting your infrastructure across multiple root modules is the best practice,
everyone agrees on this, and fighting that is an uphill battle, why do I care?

=== At-scale infrastructure is still small

Well, for one, it just grinds me gears.  Even large infrastructure is at a
scale, in terms of size of data or even API calls, that is still small relative
to the problems we solve on a daily basis with software.  The Terrateam SaaS
database already has way more data in it than will ever need to be represented
in the largest organizations Terraform state file.  We shouldn't be having to
make these concessions for such a small amount of data.  We can do this.  We can
write a CLI tool that can manage this amount of data successfully.  We are
capable.

=== The model does not change the infrastructure

Secondly, I genuinely think, of the options we have available to us, multiple
root modules is the worst representation of our infrastructure.  Think about it
like this: we have some infrastructure out there.  Whether we choose to
represent it as a Terralith or as multiple root modules, that infrastructure is
still the same.  The physical infrastructure is not impacted by our choice of
representation.  For an analogy, if we take a house, we can choose to represent
that house as two dimensional blueprints, as a three dimensional digital model,
or even as a three dimensional physical model.  The actual house does not change
based on which model we choose.

That means we should choose the model that gives us the most functionality.  In
my opinion, a Terralith is the model with the most functionality.  With a
Terralith we can:

. Plan all of our infrastructure in one operation, if we want to.
. Using `-target`, we can plan any subset of our infrastructure.  We even get to
see how dependencies have changed even if we did not specify them in the
`-target`.
. We can move resources around our state and refactor at-will using declarative operations,
such as `move` blocks and just normal refactoring code techniques.
. We can see everything in one place.
. We don't have to worry (as much) about orchestrating operations.  I say "as
much" because there simply are some scenarios where we need to let one piece of
infrastructure complete provisioning before we can run the other.  But a
Terralith doesn't make that any worse than multiple root modules.

Contrast this with multiple root modules:

. It is, by definition, not possible to plan all of our infrastructure.  While
"blast radius" is often cited as a reason to prefer a multiple root module
architecture, it's actually the opposite!  Multiple root modules makes
understanding the blast radius harder.  If we delete a resource that other root
modules depend on, our infrastructure is broken no matter how many root modules
we have, and we can see that at all given the plan.
. We cannot, dynamically, choose which portions of our infrastructure to plan.
We are locked into the root module decisions that we've made when we chose to
split our infrastructure out.
. We cannot use declarative techniques to refactor our code across root modules.
A `move` block only works within an existing root module.
. Depending on how we organized our code we may or may not be able to see
everything in one place.  If root modules are in a monorepo, then that's not
bad, however if it's across multiple repos then we need to know about every repo
to understand our infrastructure.
. We have created an orchestration problem.  If root module B depends on root
module A, now we have to encode that somewhere, and some tooling has to run that
for us, making sure dependencies are executed.

If our infrastructure is "one thing", a Terralith lets us express that "one
thing" better than multiple root modules.  It more directly represents our
infrastructure.

== How am I wrong?

Obviously, the only reason I can write this blog post is because my view is not
the mainstream.  Even
https://masterpoint.netlify.app/updates/steps-to-break-up-a-terralith/[my
friends] disagree with me.  I insist, I do not have a
https://scienceblog.com/15806/the-galileo-complex[Galileo Complex].  And I'm not
alone in being perfectly OK with a Terralith.  There are dozens of us.  Dozens
of us!

> In my opinion teams should use a single root module for each project unless
  there's a good reason not to. There's a huge value in being able to spin up an
  entire development environment with a single command. It makes testing and
  development significantly easier. If the root module consists of other
  modules, then those can still be tested and developed on their own so you
  aren't locked into launching the whole project if it isn't needed.

While I think the state of Terraform/Tofu is sufficient to manage a Terralith
at-scale, I think the situation is not ideal.  I believe we should be using a
Terralith and putting pressure on the Terraform/Tofu developers to improve the
places where is it insufficient.  My personal list of functionality that will
bring a Terralith from workable to a no-brainer is:

. A new concept that is functionally equivalent to a `module` block.  For the
sake of conversation we can call it a `stack`, but that is a terrible name.
What is special about `stack` in this fictional universe is that it can be
targeted via a `-stack` CLI option.  All of this could just be aliases for
`module` and `-target`, but the idea is we have some constraints on how this can
be used.  A core issue with `-target` is that it's unconstrained.  You can use
it in all sorts of ways that you don't actually want to.  This would allow the
author of Terraform code to express "this can be operated on its own".
. The ability to apply a `stack` in parallel.  While we can use `-target` or the
hypothetical `-stack` parameter to operate on subsets of our code, if the
underlying resources are represented in a single state file then we will not be
able to apply multiple states in parallel.  Do state backends now actually
manage multiple state files, one per `stack` or something like that?  Whatever,
I don't care, what I do care about is the semantics.  The semantics being: we
can apply multiple stacks in parallel while letting me conceptualize my
Terralith as one big state file.  However it is implement, I must be able to use
a `move` block to move resources between stacks.

With these two features, we get a conceptual tool to express our infrastructure
in a better way, and we get the ability to iterate faster by being able to
perform applies in parallel even if semantically everything appears to be on
giant state file.

== Next Steps

Even if we were to agree that a Terralith is the best way to represent
infrastructure, the existing cultural momentum for multiple root modules is very
strong.  In my experience, even getting to the point of discussing a Terralith
requires pushing through a lot of resistance, and the mention of `-target` as a
valid tool for production code is almost always like driving into a very thick
wall.  The degree that using `-target` is frowned upon is so strong that I have
failed to get anyone to articulate, on a technical level, why it's bad.  The
culture is that we don't use `-target` in production.  Full Stop.

All that is to say, there is very little progress to be made without first
getting some subset of the culture believing that it is the right choice.  And
changing culture is
https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/07/29/slow-ideas[slow].

In truth, if there is a change, it probably won't really come from me.  I'm too
abrasive for that sort of slow, step-by-step, change, I just want good Terralith
tooling now.  So probably someone more thoughtful and diplomatic will make it
happen, if it ever does happen.

Assuming that the trend is towards both a Terralith and demanding the tooling
support it better, I don't actually think it's a big technical lift from there.
The biggest change will probably be in the interface to the state backend to
support representing a single state in a more operationally friendly way.

I do think we'll get there, though.  It might take awhile.  It might even take
so long that something else supplants Terraform/Tofu.  Looking at what HashiCorp
is doing, the goal of HCP Terraform Stacks is accepting that people want to view
their infrastructure as more of a single unit.  I think the actual
implementation is not great, it's just way too complicated, but that it's being
approached, I interpret, as a tacit agreement that we want something better than
multiple root modules.  We'll get there.  If you want to play around with some
tooling I made to try to make this more possible, check out my PoC
