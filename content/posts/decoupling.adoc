The infrastructure startup Wing Cloud, creators of
https://github.com/winglang/wing[Winglang], recently
https://thenewstack.io/wing-the-startup-failed-but-the-language-has-potential/[shutdown],
after receiving a
https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230718296353/en/Wing-Cloud-Raises-%2420Million-in-Seed-Funding-to-Build-Winglang-A-Unified-Programming-Language-to-Tame-Cloud-Complexity[$20
million investment in 2023].  I did not find this surprising.  Not because the
developers aren't great or because I'm a genius business person.  It wasn't
surprising because the idea of Winglang went against my mental model of how
technical progress happens.

The idea of Winglang is to combine application code and infrastructure code.
You use a "queue" object in your code and the Winglang environment constructs
the underlying cloud infrastructure for that.  Maybe it's SQS on Amazon, and
something else on GCP.  Not only is Winglang a new programming language but also
it's a totally different way to provision and manage infrastructure.

But this whole concept violates, what I think, is the number one (or maybe top
three) lessons we've consistently learned over the last 50 years of software
development:  always be increasing the degree of decoupling.

This goes back, at least, as for as the 1972 paper
https://rauterberg.employee.id.tue.nl/presentations/parnas-1972.pdf[On the
Criteria To Be Used in Decomposing Systems into Modules] by D.L. Parnas.  In the
paper, Parnas compares a few ways to break a problem into software components.
The solution he arrives at is that by using the criteria of "information hiding"
we decompose our system such that it is more likely that a change only impacts
one or a few modules rather than the whole system.  For example, if you change
the format of your input, only the input module has to change, rather than your
whole program.

A key quote:

"By looking at these changes we can see the differences between the two
modularizations. The first change is confined to one module in both
decompositions. For the first decomposition the second change would result in
changes in every module! The same is true of the third change. In the first
decomposition the format of the line storage in core must be used by all of the
programs.  In the second decomposition the story is entirely
different. Knowledge of the exact way that the lines are stored is entirely
hidden from all but module 1. Any change in the manner of storage can be
confined to that module!  In some versions of"
-- D.L. Parnas

Decoupling is a lesson that we've seen reinforced for decades:

. **POSIX** - While it may have its issues, by decoupling the operating system
implementation from the APIs an application uses to interact with it, POSIX has
enabled a number of operation systems, with their own interesting twists, to be
implemented and used without having to rewrite every piece of software.
. **C** - By decoupling the machine that C compiles to from the semantics of the
language, a conforming C program can be compiled and run on any system that has
an implementation.  C is 53 years old (first released the same year as the
D.L. Parnas paper), and while the first version of C doesn't resemble what it is
now, its flexibility has enabled it to be a language that new software is still
developed in.
. **Generics** - By decoupling the types from the algorithm, programming
languages with generics let us express a single function that applies to a wide
range of inputs.  Compared to C, or the early days of Java and Go, where one
needed to either give up type safety or copy pasta code all over, changing just
the type, generics allow writing more correct programs.
. **ZFS** - ZFS decouples the storage available to a the file systems from how
that storage will be partitioned.  If you use ext4 or some other file systems,
you probably have been asked how you'd like to cut up your disks.  How big
should `/tmp` be?  And `/var/logs`?  With ZFS, that doesn't matter, they can be
as big as they need to be.
. **NFS, SMB, iSCSI, Amazon EBS** - By decoupling storage from compute, we can
utilize resources more effectively and separately scale the two components.
Cloud providers, AWS in particular, use this very effectively.
. **Wireless networking** - By, quite literally, decoupling where we physically
are from where the connection to the network is, I can write this blog post on
my couch without drilling holes in the wall to add an Ethernet jack.  And
because of Starlink, I could cross the Atlantic ocean on a boat while working
the entire way.
. **The Unix Philosophy** - The Unix Philosophy is about writing programs that
are meant to be used with other programs in ways the author never imagined.

The list goes on and it's fractal.  Decoupling is a good design choice in
everything from the a small library, to a CLI tool, to the whole architecture of
a product, to how companies are structured.

Decoupling is a good design choice because it increases our optionality.  With
POSIX, I have more operating systems to choose from.  With ZFS, I don't have to
worry about if I start writing a lot of content to `/tmp` because it has no
fixed size.  With wireless, I can work from my couch, or from my office, and a
Cafe can provide internet access to all of its patrons with only installing a
little bit of hardware.  We can do more things when we decouple.

Winglang, however, couples the application logic and infrastructure code via a
single language.

"Winglang addresses these pains by letting you work at a higher level of
abstraction and allowing you to focus on business logic instead of cloud
mechanics, only surfacing low-level details when it's needed."
-- https://github.com/winglang/wing[Winglang GitHub]

The reality is that the cloud mechanics are not abstractable.  Everyone of those
knobs on an AWS service that we complain about on Day 1 exists because it serves
a purpose on Day 2.  We may be able to provide reasonable defaults but they
cannot be hidden away.

Winglang focuses on solving the Day 1 problem at the cost of the Day 2 problem.
Because our code is coupled to our infrastructure, we are limited in our options
for solving Day 2 problems.  Consider questions that arise when thinking through
a system:

. What if Winglang's API doesn't provide access to the knobs we need?
. What if Winglang, the programming language, turns out to not be a powerful enough
language?
. What if the best choice for the project/organization/company is to switch to a
cloud provider Winglang doesn't support?

Winglang has us committed to its solution.

Compare this to decoupling our application code from our infrastructure code:

. The question of if the framework we're using provides access to all the knobs
we need disappears entirely.
. If the language we chose turns out to not be the right choice in the long run,
we have well understand practices and procedures for refactoring and moving to a
new language, all without touching the infrastructure code.
. As long as we have a tool that can manage the infrastructure on the new cloud
system, we can bring up our application code on it.  Likely the application code
will be changed but it won't be a complete rewrite.

We have more options in this case than with Winglang.

All this praise of decoupling isn't to say we need to do gymnastics to make it
happen.  I'm reminded of trying to read from a buffer in early versions of Java.
One had to construct, at least, three objects to do buffered I/O.  It was
unpleasant and unhelpful.  Prior to cloud providers doing networked storage at
scale, the consensus was that networked storage was a risk rather than a
benefit.  It took a needing to make it work at scale to make it a no-brainer.
If you're migrating off the cloud to on-prem, you're probably going to go back
to coupled storage and compute.

There are some places were coupling can make sense but it generally requires the
benefit to be large to offset the cost of the coupling.  For example, storing
and retrieving data in AWS S3 requires using specialized APIs.  Your application
has to be designed for it.  But the value of having an infinite object store
that can be accessed from anywhere so outweighs the cost that many developers
use it without a second thought.  And look at what happened with S3.  It has
become so useful that its API has been implemented in several cloud providers,
decoupling applications from S3!  Now your application, which was formally tied
to S3, can now be used with any S3-compatible storage.

The power of decoupling is also why, I believe, we are no closer to a
multi-cloud infrastructure platform that abstracts the different cloud
providers.  The cloud cannot be abstracted.  A multi-cloud abstraction would
couple all of them together.  The individual knobs are too useful.  When people
go multi-cloud, it's not because they want to abstract away the resources, it's
because they want to use the vendor-specific features of those resources.

There are a few other companies and projects out there trying to generate
infrastructure from code.  In general, I have a hard time imagining they will be
used beyond niche workloads.  In the end they will probably become hard to
distinguish from Pulumi.  Pulumi is not designed for writing applications but
being a full programming language, it is great for implementing "cloud glue",
little programs useful for doing management work inside of a cloud.

When evaluating a new product or project or idea, I think it's useful to take a
moment to judge whether or not it is increasing or decreasing the degree of
coupling.  If it is increasing it, before getting too excited, take a minute to
evaluate whether or not it is offsetting the cost of that coupling with the
benefits.  If not, be skeptical.
