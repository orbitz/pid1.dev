Hi, I'm Malcolm Matalka.  I'm generally a software developer, which I've been
doing for a long time.  I am also co-founder of
https://www.terrateam.io[Terrateam] which is a an open-source
Infrastructure-as-Code orchestrator.  I'm into software development as a field
of engineering as well as a creative outlet.  I write applications for myself
(which I call DIY Software) including a podcast player and a food tracking
application.  I prefer to write software in Ocaml and I'm known for writing a
lot of my own frameworks and tools.
